This script provides syntax highlighting for the OpenOffice 1.x and StarOffice 5.2, 6.x, 7.x setup responses file as documented by http://installation.openoffice.org/01RESPONSE_SO52_final_rev2.pdf

A test suite for the highlighting is provided (TestSuite.OOo) to help discover bugs. Do not use it with the setup program.

Release notes for 1.0 :
- syntax is quite strict about spaces (stricter than the setup program). The TestSuite.OOo will show you what is recognized.
- the Module_Specify may not correctly highlight module sets definitions. Patches are welcome.
